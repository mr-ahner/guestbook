# GuestBook
Welcome to nazbook. Nazbook is a guestbook software built in PHP written by me. There is a mod panel that lets you ban users, there is ip logging, and the basic guestbook functions. 
If I were you, I'd read the entire codebase, then you'd understand. You can also check the live example on my website. In the mod panel, the password is set as "123" YOU NEED TO CHANGE THIS. Also, remeber this password
is HARD-CODED, and is NOT secure. The mod panel only allows you to put a ip in, and that puts the ip in the banned user list, so for any user to guess your password or find it, they, to ban any user, would still need to know
their ip, which is unlikly. On the live example the password is still "123", so you can test it out with your own ip, just so you can test it. If I ever need to ban people, I guess I might change it.
